      <h3>Tripcodes</h3>
      <p>
        Tripcodes are a way to differentiate yourself from other users. They are a way to have a unique identifier
        without needing to create an account. They are generated by taking a password and hashing it with a
        cryptographic hash function. The result is a unique identifier that can be used to identify you across
        different threads.
      </p>
      <p>
        To use a tripcode, simply enter your tripcode password in the "Tripcode Password" field when creating a new thread
        or comment. If you don't enter a password, a tripcode will be generated for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tripcodes based on easy to guess passwords are not secure. If you want to ensure that your tripcode can not be spoofed,
        use a strong password that cannot be guessed easily.
